# 💻 Laptop Price Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts laptop prices based on their technical specifications.  
The goal was to compare algorithms and identify the best-performing model for price prediction.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Consumers and retailers want to estimate laptop prices based on features such as CPU, RAM, GPU, storage, and display.

## 🛠️ Approach
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature relationships.  
- Processed categorical variables (e.g., brand, processor).  
- Trained and evaluated models:
  - Linear Regression  
  - Random Forest Regressor  
  - XGBoost Regressor  
- Compared model performances on R² and RMSE.  

## 📊 Key Insights
- RAM and processor speed had the highest correlation with price.  
- Random Forest and XGBoost achieved higher accuracy than Linear Regression.  
- Feature engineering (e.g., log-transforming storage) improved predictions.

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Jupyter Notebook
