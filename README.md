## 🛠️ Approach
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**
   - Used a dataset of laptop specifications and prices.
   - Handled missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent entries.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Checked correlations between specifications (RAM, CPU, GPU, etc.) and price.
   - Visualized distributions and outliers.

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Encoded categorical variables (brand, processor, GPU).
   - Applied transformations (Standard scale).

4. **Modeling**
   - Trained and compared regression models:
     - Linear Regression
     - Random Forest Regressor
     - XGBoost Regressor
   - Evaluated using R² and RMSE.

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Compared performance metrics.
   - Interpreted feature importance from tree-based models.

## 📊 Key Insights
- **RAM and Processor** were the most influential factors in determining laptop prices.  
- **Random Forest and XGBoost** models performed better than Linear Regression.  
- Feature engineering significantly improved model accuracy.
